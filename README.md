# symfony-legacy

Create new symfony 1.4 projects easily with Composer.

## What's included?

This package includes a predefined set of plugins that I find myself using in
every symfony project I start. Feel free to fork it and customized it to fit
*your* needs.

Bundled plugins:

* **sfPropelORMPlugin**
* **dcReferenceModelPlugin**
* **dcReloadedFormExtraPlugin**

## Usage

1. Get [Composer](http://getcomposer.org).
2. Create a project using this installer:

```bash
$ composer create-project ncuesta/symfony-legacy path/to/your/hawt/project
$ cd path/to/your/hawt/project
$ php bin/symfony generate:project HawtnessProject
```

**This rather hacky way to start the project will be automated and improved soon.**
